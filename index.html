    <p>Ciphers are cool. I came across an interesting cipher created by a friend on Facebook. It was a public post and a few friends of the individual were commenting with the known secret characters. </p>
    <p>For example, a message stated, <em>"42325371 6132 4361 7463 2153636232"</em></p>

    <p>A couple interesting features to note:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the length, N, of the string of numbers is even (mod 2)</li>
      <li>N is not (mod 4), so four digit numbers are unlikely to represent anything</li>
      <li>two digit integers like 61 repeat</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Different simple ciphers rely on a key where each special character is defined. This cipher is not too different. Two digit integers are used to represent a letter of the alphabet. How can we figure out which two digit number encodes which letter?
    Note: It could've also been possible for the two digit numbers to encode punctuation, but I disregarded the possibility since multiple messages would end with a period, exclamation mark, question mark, etc. and distinct numbers at the end of the messages would repeat.
    Also: As I will explain, this cipher could have been harder to crack if, for example, the encodings were different for each message depending on the current date, hour, or minute.</p>

    <p>Now, the problem was simplified: each of the 26 letters of the alphabet had their own encoding (a number from 10 to 99), and all I would need to do was figure out which letter was represented by a certain number.
    If I only had one message to work with, I would need to guess the message before assigning letters. Fortunately, there were many ciphers posted (all using the same encoding).</p>

    <p>To begin, I had to try guessing which number corresponded to which letter. The English language has few one letter and two letter words that are commonly used. For example, there are two one letter words, "a" and "I". There are a few two letter words: "of", "to", "is", "so", etc.
    Then, after bringing in all the messages into a Python script, I started to guess a few of the words and continually checked to see if other words appeared.</p>
