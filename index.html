    <p>Ciphers are cool. I came across an interesting cipher created by a friend on Facebook. It was a public post and a few friends of the individual were commenting with the known secret characters. </p>
    <p>For example, a message stated, "<em> "42325371 6132 4361 7463 2153636232"</em></p>

    <p>A couple interesting features to note:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the length, N, of the string of numbers is even (mod 2)</li>
      <li>N is not (mod 4), so four digit numbers are unlikely to represent ASCII characters</li>
      <li>two digit integers like 61 repeat</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Different simple ciphers rely on a key where each special character is defined. This cipher is not too different. Two digit integers are used to represent a letter of the alphabet. How can we figure out which two digit number encodes which letter?
    Note: It could've also been possible for the two digit numbers to also encode punctuation, but I disregarded the possibility since multiple messages would end with a period, exclamation mark, question mark, etc. and a number at the end of the messages would repeat.
    Also: As I will explain, this cipher could have been harder to crack if, for example, the encodings were different for each message depending on the current date, hour, or minute.</p>
